# Findings

## High 

### [H-1] Mixing up variable location causes storage collisions in `ThunderLoan::s_flashLoanFee` and `ThunderLoan::s_currentlyFlashLoaning`

**Description:** `ThunderLoan.sol` has two variables in the following order:

```javascript
    uint256 private s_feePrecision;
    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
```

However, the expected upgraded contract `ThunderLoanUpgraded.sol` has them in a different order. 

```javascript
    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
    uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;
```

Due to how Solidity storage works, after the upgrade, the `s_flashLoanFee` will have the value of `s_feePrecision`. You cannot adjust the positions of storage variables when working with upgradeable contracts. 


**Impact:** After upgrade, the `s_flashLoanFee` will have the value of `s_feePrecision`. This means that users who take out flash loans right after an upgrade will be charged the wrong fee. Additionally the `s_currentlyFlashLoaning` mapping will start on the wrong storage slot.

**Proof of Code:**

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>
Add the following code to the `ThunderLoanTest.t.sol` file. 

```javascript
// You'll need to import `ThunderLoanUpgraded` as well
import { ThunderLoanUpgraded } from "../../src/upgradedProtocol/ThunderLoanUpgraded.sol";

function testUpgradeBreaks() public {
        uint256 feeBeforeUpgrade = thunderLoan.getFee();
        vm.startPrank(thunderLoan.owner());
        ThunderLoanUpgraded upgraded = new ThunderLoanUpgraded();
        thunderLoan.upgradeTo(address(upgraded));
        uint256 feeAfterUpgrade = thunderLoan.getFee();

        assert(feeBeforeUpgrade != feeAfterUpgrade);
    }
```
</details>

You can also see the storage layout difference by running `forge inspect ThunderLoan storage` and `forge inspect ThunderLoanUpgraded storage`

**Recommended Mitigation:** Do not switch the positions of the storage variables on upgrade, and leave a blank if you're going to replace a storage variable with a constant. In `ThunderLoanUpgraded.sol`:

```diff
-    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
-    uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;
+    uint256 private s_blank;
+    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; 
+    uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;
```

### [H-2] Unnecessary `updateExchangeRate` in `deposit` function incorrectly updates `exchangeRate` preventing withdraws and unfairly changing reward distribution

**Description:** 

```javascript
    function deposit(IERC20 token, uint256 amount) external revertIfZero(amount) revertIfNotAllowedToken(token) {
        AssetToken assetToken = s_tokenToAssetToken[token];
        uint256 exchangeRate = assetToken.getExchangeRate();
        uint256 mintAmount = (amount * assetToken.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION()) / exchangeRate;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, token, amount);
        assetToken.mint(msg.sender, mintAmount);
        uint256 calculatedFee = getCalculatedFee(token, amount);
        assetToken.updateExchangeRate(calculatedFee);
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(assetToken), amount);
    }
```

**Impact:** 

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

### [H-3] By calling a flashloan and then `ThunderLoan::deposit` instead of `ThunderLoan::repay` users can steal all funds from the protocol

### [H-4] getPriceOfOnePoolTokenInWeth uses the TSwap price which doesn't account for decimals, also fee precision is 18 decimals

## Medium 

### [M-1] Centralization risk for trusted owners

#### Impact:
Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: src/protocol/ThunderLoan.sol

223:     function setAllowedToken(IERC20 token, bool allowed) external onlyOwner returns (AssetToken) {

261:     function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner { }
```

#### Contralized owners can brick redemptions by disapproving of a specific token


### [M-2] Using TSwap as price oracle leads to price and oracle manipulation attacks

**Description:** The TSwap protocol is a constant product formula based AMM (automated market maker). The price of a token is determined by how many reserves are on either side of the pool. Because of this, it is easy for malicious users to manipulate the price of a token by buying or selling a large amount of the token in the same transaction, essentially ignoring protocol fees. 

**Impact:** Liquidity providers will drastically reduced fees for providing liquidity. 

**Proof of Concept:** 

The following all happens in 1 transaction. 

1. User takes a flash loan from `ThunderLoan` for 1000 `tokenA`. They are charged the original fee `fee1`. During the flash loan, they do the following:
   1. User sells 1000 `tokenA`, tanking the price. 
   2. Instead of repaying right away, the user takes out another flash loan for another 1000 `tokenA`. 
      1. Due to the fact that the way `ThunderLoan` calculates price based on the `TSwapPool` this second flash loan is substantially cheaper. 
```javascript
    function getPriceInWeth(address token) public view returns (uint256) {
        address swapPoolOfToken = IPoolFactory(s_poolFactory).getPool(token);
@>      return ITSwapPool(swapPoolOfToken).getPriceOfOnePoolTokenInWeth();
    }
```
    3. The user then repays the first flash loan, and then repays the second flash loan.

I have created a proof of code located in my `audit-data` folder. It is too large to include here. 

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider using a different price oracle mechanism, like a Chainlink price feed with a Uniswap TWAP fallback oracle. 



### [M-4] Fee on transfer, rebase, etc

## Low

### [L-1] Empty Function Body - Consider commenting why

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: src/protocol/ThunderLoan.sol

261:     function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner { }

```

### [L-2] Initializers could be front-run
Initializers could be front-run, allowing an attacker to either set their own values, take ownership of the contract, and in the best case forcing a re-deployment

*Instances (6)*:
```solidity
File: src/protocol/OracleUpgradeable.sol

11:     function __Oracle_init(address poolFactoryAddress) internal onlyInitializing {

```

```solidity
File: src/protocol/ThunderLoan.sol

138:     function initialize(address tswapAddress) external initializer {

138:     function initialize(address tswapAddress) external initializer {

139:         __Ownable_init();

140:         __UUPSUpgradeable_init();

141:         __Oracle_init(tswapAddress);

```

### [L-3] Missing critial event emissions

**Description:** When the `ThunderLoan::s_flashLoanFee` is updated, there is no event emitted. 

**Recommended Mitigation:** Emit an event when the `ThunderLoan::s_flashLoanFee` is updated.

```diff 
+    event FlashLoanFeeUpdated(uint256 newFee);
.
.
.
    function updateFlashLoanFee(uint256 newFee) external onlyOwner {
        if (newFee > s_feePrecision) {
            revert ThunderLoan__BadNewFee();
        }
        s_flashLoanFee = newFee;
+       emit FlashLoanFeeUpdated(newFee); 
    }
```

## Informational 

### [I-1] Poor Test Coverage 

```

| File                               | % Lines        | % Statements   | % Branches    | % Funcs        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| src/protocol/AssetToken.sol        | 70.00% (7/10)  | 76.92% (10/13) | 50.00% (1/2)  | 66.67% (4/6)   |
| src/protocol/OracleUpgradeable.sol | 100.00% (6/6)  | 100.00% (9/9)  | 100.00% (0/0) | 80.00% (4/5)   |
| src/protocol/ThunderLoan.sol       | 64.52% (40/62) | 68.35% (54/79) | 37.50% (6/16) | 71.43% (10/14) |
```

### [I-2] Not using `__gap[50]` for future storage collision mitigation

### [I-3] Different decimals may cause confusion. ie: AssetToken has 18, but asset has 6

### [I-4] Doesn't follow https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156

**Recommended Mitigation:** Aim to get test coverage up to over 90% for all files. 

## Gas

### [GAS-1] Using bools for storage incurs overhead
Use `uint256(1)` and `uint256(2)` for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (100 gas), and to avoid Gsset (20000 gas) when changing from ‘false’ to ‘true’, after having been ‘true’ in the past. See [source](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/58f635312aa21f947cae5f8578638a85aa2519f5/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L23-L27).

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: src/protocol/ThunderLoan.sol

98:     mapping(IERC20 token => bool currentlyFlashLoaning) private s_currentlyFlashLoaning;

```

### [GAS-2] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

*Instances (3)*:
```solidity
File: src/protocol/AssetToken.sol

25:     uint256 public constant EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION = 1e18;

```

```solidity
File: src/protocol/ThunderLoan.sol

95:     uint256 public constant FLASH_LOAN_FEE = 3e15; // 0.3% ETH fee

96:     uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;

```

### [GAS-3] Unnecessary SLOAD when logging new exchange rate

In `AssetToken::updateExchangeRate`, after writing the `newExchangeRate` to storage, the function reads the value from storage again to log it in the `ExchangeRateUpdated` event. 

To avoid the unnecessary SLOAD, you can log the value of `newExchangeRate`.

```diff
  s_exchangeRate = newExchangeRate;
- emit ExchangeRateUpdated(s_exchangeRate);
+ emit ExchangeRateUpdated(newExchangeRate);
```
